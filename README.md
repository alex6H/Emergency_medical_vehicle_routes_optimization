ABSTRACT : 
The patients survival rate out-of-hospital depends directly on how
quickly emergency medical services (EMS) arrive. Therefore, the vehicle with the shortest
estimated time of arrival (ETA) should be sent to the scene. This is a considerable
challenge, particularly in urban areas where traffic congestion is significant and the
road network complex. Currently, ETA is calculated on a theoretical basis. This work
attempts to create a draft navigation system based on position data and therefore actual
speeds. The aim is to identify the influence of traffic, improve ETA, enhance vehicle
selection and route choice. The concept is applied to Brussels fire and emergency medical
service data. The average speeds of EMS vehicles are calculated and input into a
navigation system. The experiment uses the Open Source RoutingMachine library for
map matching and routing, as well as a Python script for error correction and speed
calculation. The procedure and results are compared to the Poulton[78] study, the only
work to date using position data for EMS navigation. In Brussels, we observe that automobile
congestion clearly modifies the average speed of EMS during peak hours. From
the speed analysis, we obtain a draft of a functional navigation system, based on data
with a realistic ETA.
