## Abstract : 
The patients survival rate out-of-hospital depends directly on how quickly emergency medical services (EMS) arrive. Therefore, the vehicle with the shortest estimated time of arrival (ETA) should be sent to the scene. This is a considerable challenge, particularly in urban areas where traffic congestion is significant and the road network complex. Currently, ETA is calculated on a theoretical basis. This work attempts to create a draft navigation system based on position data and therefore actual speeds. The aim is to identify the influence of traffic, improve ETA, enhance vehicle selection and route choice. The concept is applied to [Brussels fire and emergency medical service](https://be.brussels/en/about-region/structure-and-organisations/administrations-and-institutions-region/siamurbc/location-our-fire-stations) data. The average speeds of EMS vehicles are calculated and input into a navigation system. The experiment uses the Open Source RoutingMachine library for map matching and routing, as well as a Python script for error correction and speed calculation. The procedure and results are compared to the [Poulton study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03181), the only work to date using position data for EMS navigation. In Brussels, we observe that automobile congestion clearly modifies the average speed of EMS during peak hours. From the speed analysis, we obtain a draft of a functional navigation system, based on data with a realistic ETA.

## Research Problem
Current EMS dispatch systems calculate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) using theoretical speeds, which can be highly inaccurate in real-world traffic conditions. This project demonstrates how real-world vehicle tracking data can significantly improve:

- ‚è±Ô∏è ETA Accuracy: More realistic arrival time predictions
- üöó Vehicle Selection: Better choice of which ambulance to dispatch
- üó∫Ô∏è Route Optimization: Improved path planning considering actual traffic conditions
- üìä Traffic Impact Analysis: Understanding how congestion affects emergency response

## Key Findings

- **Proof of concept**: Demonstrated feasibility of a custom navigation model for emergency vehicles using historical GPS data, providing more accurate ETA predictions and vehicle selection than theoretical or conventional systems.
- **Key insights**:
  - Public navigation systems consistently overestimate EMS ETAs in urban settings.
  - Data quality (sampling interval, HDOP, azimuth) is critical for reliable map matching and speed estimation; SIAMU's lack of these attributes imposed limitations.
  - Average EMS speeds in Brussels: 44.5 km/h (ambulances), 54.5 km/h (medicalized vehicles), with clear congestion effects during peak hours.
  - Segment-level speed profiles enable dynamic, hourly weighting of the road network for EMS routing‚Äîan improvement over static approaches.
- **Limitations**:
  - Results affected by data gaps, lack of HDOP/azimuth, arbitrary thresholds (e.g., minimum 20 passes per segment).
  - Segments lacking empirical speed data revert to default routing values, potentially biasing ETA estimates.
  - The system is a research prototype; operational deployment would require further validation and refinement.

## Future Directions

- **Data enhancement**: Incorporate azimuth, HDOP, and more granular sampling to improve map matching and confidence.
- **Comparative studies**: Benchmark performance against other routing methods and integrate additional years of data for temporal modeling.
- **Isochrone analysis**: Use real travel times to delineate EMS service areas and identify underserved zones for resource allocation.
- **Sensor fusion**: Integrate multi-source positioning (WiFi, cellular, GNSS) to mitigate urban canyon effects and improve accuracy.
- **Operationalization**: Develop real-time updates using live traffic, incident, and weather data; enable embedded use in dispatch centers and vehicles.
- **Network effects**: Exploit V2X (vehicle-to-infrastructure) for dynamic traffic light prioritization and incident avoidance.
- **Machine learning**: Leverage predictive analytics for continuous ETA optimization, considering evolving road, traffic, and environmental conditions.

## Technology Stack

- **Routing engine**: [OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)](https://project-osrm.org/)
- **Programming**: Python for data processing and error correction
- **Mapping data**: [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
- **GIS processing**: Map matching and route calculation
- **Data source**: Brussels SIAMU vehicle tracking data

# Chapter Summaries

## Chapter 1: Introduction

**Motivations**
- Survival rates in critical emergencies depend directly on EMS response time, which is hindered by severe urban congestion in Brussels.
- Current Belgian EMS dispatch relies on theoretical travel times, ignoring real traffic conditions and leading to unreliable ETA predictions.
- Leveraging historical EMS vehicle data enables data-driven routing, yielding more accurate ETAs and optimal vehicle selection.

**Limits**
- This work is a proof of concept; it does not aim to deliver a production system or comprehensive velocity analysis.
- Only data from 2017 and two EMS vehicle types are used to ensure data quality and manageable processing.
- Analysis focuses on feasibility within the Brussels region, not broader generalization or real-time integration.

**Methodology**
- The thesis combines a theoretical review (EMS organization, routing theory, map matching) and a practical application to Brussels EMS data.
- Data is cleaned, filtered, and processed using OSRM and Python geospatial libraries to reconstruct and analyze routes.
- The system's ETA predictions and routing are compared against prior research (notably the [London Ambulance Service study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03181)).
